Hello Everyone........I am Protyush Dey, MERN STACK developer enthusiast..
Here, I have created a nice and beautiful project named Bubble_Game.
There are lots of Bubbles in the screen and 3 parameters are there--> i)Hit, ii)Timer, iii)Score......

-> We have to click on bubbles with a number matching with hit value and whenever we hit right bubble matching with 
Hit value,the score will automatically updated by +10 with it's present value.

-> There is a timer of 60 seconds, whenever the timer will equal to zero, the Game will be over..and after refreshing the page we can start the game from the beginning...

-> After clicking bubbles each and every time, Hit value will be changed and new bubbles will be created on the screen...
